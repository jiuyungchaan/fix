   1) Network Connectivity: Configuration of customer-side physical devices to interface with CME Group environments
      I. Production Environment Connectivity
      II.Certification Environment Connectivity
   2) Certification(AutoCert+): Transactions of all client systems on CME Globex via iLink order routing or processing CME Group market data should be certified by AutoCert+, an automated testing tool for validating client system functionality.
      I. Certification environment: Certify a client system for core functionality.
      II.New Release environment: Certify testing on new functionality.
   3) Market Data Platform(MDP 3.0): Disseminate event-based bid, ask, trade, and statistical data for CME Group markets and also provide revocery and support services for market data processing.
   4) iLink Order Entry: Path by which client systems connect to and transact business on the CME Globex platform. Engineers should develop the basic functionality required for a client system to connect to and maintain a FIX session on CME Globex.
   5) Drop Copy: Drop Copy service allows customers to receive real-time copies of CME Globex Execution Report and Acknowledgment messages as they are sent over iLink order entry system sessions on a seperate, dedicated path.
   6) Firmsoft: A browser-based order management tool that provides real-time access to information on working and filled orders across multiple firms.
